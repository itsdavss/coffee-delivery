## My process

During the development of this project, I had the opportunity to practice and enhance my TypeScript skills, deepening my understanding of type systems. I also worked with key React concepts such as state management, Context API, state immutability, lists and keys in ReactJS, props, and componentization. Additionally, I took the initiative to implement extra features, including address auto-fill via an API and a custom alert for users who attempt to select an address outside the city of SÃ£o Paulo, among other improvements.
